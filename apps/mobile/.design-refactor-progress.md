# Design System Refactor Progress

This file tracks progress on the design system reimplementation. Each session appends a new section at the top.

## Session: 2026-01-16

### Completed
- [x] Create `lib/theme/colors.ts` with semantic color tokens
- [x] Define light mode values
- [x] Define dark mode values
- [x] Choose specific hex value for "muted indigo" accent

### Files Changed
- `lib/theme/colors.ts` (new file)

### Notes
- Chose `#5856D6` (light) / `#5E5CE6` (dark) for the muted indigo accent color. These are iOS system indigo colors, which provide a calm, familiar feel that aligns with the design system's principle of preferring familiar iOS patterns.
- Light mode text colors use iOS-standard semantic colors for consistency with the platform.
- Dark mode colors follow iOS dark mode conventions with proper contrast ratios for WCAG AA compliance.
- All feedback colors (success, warning, error, info) use iOS system colors for familiarity.
