# Design System Refactor Progress

This file tracks progress on the design system reimplementation. Each session appends a new section at the top.

## Session: 2026-01-16 (Typography Tokens)

### Completed
- [x] Create `lib/theme/typography.ts` with text styles

### Files Changed
- `lib/theme/typography.ts` (new file)

### Notes
- Created typography tokens matching the design system spec exactly:
  - `title.large`: size 28, weight semibold (600)
  - `title.medium`: size 22, weight semibold (600)
  - `title.small`: size 18, weight semibold (600)
  - `body.primary`: size 16, weight regular (400)
  - `body.secondary`: size 14, weight regular (400)
  - `caption`: size 12, weight regular (400)
- Exported `Typography`, `TitleVariant`, and `BodyVariant` types for type-safe usage.
- Used React Native's `TextStyle['fontWeight']` type assertion for font weights to ensure compatibility.
- Followed the same export pattern as colors.ts and spacing.ts for consistency.

## Session: 2026-01-16 (Spacing Tokens)

### Completed
- [x] Create `lib/theme/spacing.ts` with spacing scale

### Files Changed
- `lib/theme/spacing.ts` (new file)

### Notes
- Created spacing scale following the design system spec with base unit of 4: xs (4), sm (8), md (16), lg (24), xl (32), 2xl (48).
- Exported `Spacing` type and `SpacingKey` type for type-safe usage.
- Followed the same export pattern as colors.ts for consistency.

## Session: 2026-01-16

### Completed
- [x] Create `lib/theme/colors.ts` with semantic color tokens
- [x] Define light mode values
- [x] Define dark mode values
- [x] Choose specific hex value for "muted indigo" accent

### Files Changed
- `lib/theme/colors.ts` (new file)

### Notes
- Chose `#5856D6` (light) / `#5E5CE6` (dark) for the muted indigo accent color. These are iOS system indigo colors, which provide a calm, familiar feel that aligns with the design system's principle of preferring familiar iOS patterns.
- Light mode text colors use iOS-standard semantic colors for consistency with the platform.
- Dark mode colors follow iOS dark mode conventions with proper contrast ratios for WCAG AA compliance.
- All feedback colors (success, warning, error, info) use iOS system colors for familiarity.
