### Sign Up & Sign In with Auth0 - COMPLETED

**Implementation:**
- Integrated Auth0 authentication using the `react-native-auth0` package

- Updated `app.config.js` to load Auth0 credentials from environment variables
- Added `.env` files to `.gitignore` for security
- Supports dev/prod builds with different Auth0 applications and bundle IDs

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User taps "Sign Up" or "Sign In" on landing screen
2. Auth0 Universal Login opens in browser
3. User completes authentication
4. App receives callback with credentials
5. Tokens stored securely in device keychain/keystore
6. User data fetched from Auth0 userInfo endpoint
7. Auth state updated, user redirected to home screen
8. On app restart, session automatically restored from secure storage

**Auth0 Dashboard Configuration Required:**
For both dev and prod applications in Auth0:
- **Application Type:** Native
- **Grant Types:** Authorization Code, Refresh Token
- **Allowed Callback URLs:**
  - Dev: `com.chestercarmer.zottie.dev://auth0/callback`
