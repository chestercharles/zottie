    "name": "In-app theme toggle",
    "description": "Add a theme toggle to the Settings screen that allows users to choose between Light, Dark, or System (default) appearance. The toggle should appear as a segmented control or list selection near the top of Settings. The user's preference should persist across app launches using AsyncStorage. When set to System, the app follows the device's system preference (current behavior). When set to Light or Dark, the app uses that mode regardless of system setting. The theme context should wrap the app and provide the resolved color scheme to the existing useTheme hook. No visual changes to the actual light/dark colors - just adding the ability to override the system preference."

    "name": "iOS Calendar-style search overlay for pantry",
    "description": "When the search icon is tapped, an overlay slides down from the top of the screen, covering the navigation header. The overlay contains: a search text input with placeholder 'Search pantry items...', a small X button inside the search input to clear the current search term, and a large X button to the right of the search input to exit search mode entirely. The overlay uses spring animations (withSpring from react-native-reanimated) for entering and exiting to match iOS patterns. While in search mode, the pantry list shows only items matching the search term (using existing filtering logic). Exiting search mode clears the search term and dismisses the overlay with animation."

  {
    "name": "Pantry search overlay keyboard behavior",
    "description": "When the search overlay appears, the search input should automatically receive focus and the keyboard should appear. Tapping the large X to exit search mode should dismiss the keyboard and the overlay simultaneously. The search input should have a clear button (small X) that clears text without dismissing the overlay or keyboard. Pressing the keyboard's return/search key should dismiss the keyboard but keep the overlay visible with results filtered. This follows standard iOS search behavior where the search results remain visible after keyboard dismissal."
