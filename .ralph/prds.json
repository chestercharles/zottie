    "description": "Add a new 'Go-tos' tab where users can save and manage go-to meals - dishes they know how to make and want quick access to. Go-tos are shared at the household level: all household members see the same go-tos and can create, edit, or delete any of them. Each go-to has a name, a freeform text field describing what's needed to make it (ingredients, amounts, notes), and tracks who created it. The data structure: name string, 'needs' text string, and createdBy user reference. The list screen shows cards with the go-to name, a truncated preview of the needs text, and subtle attribution showing who created it (e.g., 'by Chester' or a small avatar). Tapping a card opens the edit screen. The create/edit screen has two fields: a name input at the top, then a 'needs' label followed by a multiline text area. This creates a natural sentence structure: '[Name] needs [ingredients text]'. The text input includes a microphone button for voice input - users can tap to record and speak their ingredients naturally, which transcribes into the text field. A delete option appears at the bottom of the edit screen. The plus button in the header creates a new go-to (attributed to the current user). This tab serves as the foundation for go-tos - users can create and manage them here, and later the Assistant will gain the ability to use this data when helping with shopping lists.",

    "name": "(Go-tos Epic) Assistant integration for go-tos",
    "description": "Give the Assistant awareness of the user's saved go-tos so it can help with meal planning and shopping. The Assistant should be able to: (1) Use go-tos when adding to shopping list - when a user says 'add what I need for pork and beans', the Assistant looks up that go-to, checks the pantry for what's already in stock, and adds only the missing items to the shopping list. The Assistant should confirm what was added and mention if anything was skipped because it's already in the pantry. (2) Reference go-tos in general conversation - the Assistant should know what go-tos exist so it can suggest them or answer questions like 'what do I need to make my stir fry?' The go-to's 'needs' field is freeform text, so the Assistant interprets it contextually - it can handle specific items ('pinto beans'), vague descriptions ('some kind of protein'), and quantity hints ('lots of butter'). When checking pantry status against quantity hints, the Assistant should warn if an item is running low and the go-to needs 'a lot' of it. To create, edit, or delete go-tos, users go to the Go-tos tab.",

    "name": "Separate restocking intent from stock status",
    "description": "Refactor the data model to separate 'how much do I have' from 'do I want to buy more'. Currently, 'dormant' is a status that overwrites stock level (in_stock, running_low, out_of_stock), which conflates two different concepts. The fix: add a 'restocking' boolean field (default true) to pantry items, and remove 'dormant' from the status enum. Data model changes: Add 'restocking' boolean column to pantryItems table (default true). Remove 'dormant' from pantryItemStatus enum. Migration: existing dormant items become restocking=false with status='out_of_stock'. API changes: pantryItemUpdate accepts 'restocking' parameter, pantryItemList returns 'restocking' field, update type definitions in both API and mobile apps. UI changes: Rename 'Dormant Items' section to 'Bought Before' - this section shows items where restocking=false. Filter logic changes from status==='dormant' to restocking===false. Swipe action 'Dormant' becomes 'Set aside' and sets restocking=false (keeps current stock status). Swipe action 'Activate' sets restocking=true. Shopping list 'Don't want to buy it' sets restocking=false (keeps stock status intact). Remove 'dormant' from status picker on detail screen. Add restocking toggle to detail screen (separate from status picker). This change can be deployed all at once since there's only one user in production. The key benefit: a 'running low' item that the user doesn't want to restock stays visible in the main pantry (still running low) rather than disappearing into a separate section.",

    "description": "Fix the assistant chat so that confirmation prompts remain visible after the user responds. Currently, when the assistant asks for confirmation (e.g., 'Add black beans and cumin to your shopping list?') and the user taps Yes or No, the message bubble becomes blank. Instead, the bubble should show: (1) The full details of what the assistant proposed (e.g., 'Add black beans and cumin to shopping list'), and (2) A clear indicator of what the user chose and what happened. If confirmed: show that the action was executed (e.g., 'Added black beans and cumin to shopping list ✓' or similar confirmed state). If cancelled: show that the user declined (e.g., 'Add black beans and cumin to shopping list - Cancelled'). This gives users a clear history of what actions were proposed, what they decided, and what actually happened in their conversation with the assistant.",
