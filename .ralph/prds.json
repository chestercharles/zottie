    "name": "Automatic OTA updates",
    "description": "Enable automatic over-the-air updates so users receive the latest app version without needing to go through the App Store. The app should check for updates on launch and silently download any available updates in the background. Updates are applied automatically on the next app restart with no user interaction required. This uses Expo's default update behavior - no custom UI or prompts needed. Implementation involves configuring expo-updates in app.config.js with appropriate runtime versioning and ensuring EAS Update is properly set up.",

    "description": "The search overlay animation on the Pantry screen feels too bouncy when appearing, which is inconsistent with iOS native search bar behavior. When the user taps the search icon in the header, the search bar slides down from the top but overshoots its final position before settling back. iOS native search animations (like in Settings or Mail apps) use critically-damped springs that slide smoothly without overshoot. The animation should be adjusted to feel more native and polished - a smooth, quick slide-in without the bounce. This affects the SearchOverlay component in the PantryListScreen.",
