    "name": "(Onboarding Epic) Simplify onboarding to shopping list only",
    "description": "Streamline the onboarding flow to focus solely on the shopping list, removing both the pantry input step and the household invitation step. The new flow: user is asked 'What do you need from the store?', speaks their shopping list items via voice input, sees a brief processing screen, then lands directly in the app. This gets users to value faster - they can immediately use their shopping list without the upfront friction of documenting their entire pantry. The pantry setup becomes a separate, contextual experience (see companion PRD). The household invite feature remains accessible from settings for users who want to share lists later.",

    "name": "(Onboarding Epic) Pantry contextual onboarding card",
    "description": "Add an onboarding card to the Pantry tab that appears when the user has no in-stock items. This card pitches the value of filling out their pantry: 'Tell me what's in your pantry and I can help you figure out what to make for dinner, remind you when you're running low, and keep your shopping list updated automatically.' The card includes a prominent voice input button (reusing the voice input pattern from onboarding) so users can speak their pantry items naturally. The card persists until the user has added at least one in-stock item - there is no manual dismiss option. This creates a gentle but consistent nudge toward the pantry setup while letting users engage with it when they're ready, rather than forcing it during initial onboarding. If the pantry has planned items (from the shopping list) but no in-stock items, those planned items should still be visible below the onboarding card.",

    "description": "After completing the onboarding voice input flow, land users on the Shopping tab instead of the Pantry tab. Users just told us what they need from the store - they should immediately see those items on their shopping list where they expect them.

    "description": "Update the onboarding voice input screen prompt from 'What do you need from the store?' to 'What should we add to your shopping list?'

This teaches the core value loop: changes in your pantry automatically update your shopping list. The feedback should be dismissible and only appear once (first time across the user's lifetime, not per-item). This is the 'aha moment' where users understand why tracking pantry status matters.",

Change the current copy from 'Items that are running low or out of stock will appear here' to something more actionable like 'Mark items in your Pantry as running low to add them here, or tap + to add items directly.' The empty state should teach users the connection between pantry status and shopping list rather than just describing what appears here passively.",

For example, if a user asks 'should I buy more milk?', the assistant can factor in that they last purchased milk 2 weeks ago. The last purchase date should be included in the context for any items the assistant is reasoning about - whether they're currently in the pantry, on the shopping list, or just mentioned in the conversation. This is backend-only; the last purchase date doesn't need to be displayed in the app UI.",

This includes: removing the Commands tab from navigation, deleting the Commands UI components, removing any backend endpoints that were exclusively used by the Commands feature, and cleaning up any related state management or hooks. Before deleting, verify that no code is shared with the Assistant feature - the implementer should check for any dependencies between Commands and Assistant to ensure nothing breaks.

This keeps the main pantry view focused on items the user is actively tracking while still giving visibility to dormant items (things they own but don't intend to repurchase). The dormant section should be clearly labeled so users understand why these items are separated. Dormant items remain tappable to view/edit details.

This prompt should be eliminated to create a smoother authentication experience. The solution is to enable ephemeral sessions in the Auth0 configuration by passing ephemeralSession: true to the authorize call. This tells iOS to use a private browser session instead of the shared Safari cookie jar, which bypasses the permission prompt. Trade-off: SSO across apps will not work, but this is acceptable for a standalone mobile app. For logout on iOS, use clearCredentials() instead of clearSession() to avoid the prompt appearing during sign-out as well.",

There are also differences in padding between individual list items. Apply the Shopping List's spacing pattern to the Pantry screen so both screens feel like parts of the same cohesive app. This includes: consistent spacing between the header and the first list item, and consistent vertical padding between list items (accounting for the fact that Shopping List items are taller due to checkboxes).",

This is a focused, non-conversational endpoint designed for quick item addition - it extracts item names from speech like 'cherries, grapes, and some milk' and returns actions that can be passed to /api/commands/execute. It should handle status hints in the input (e.g., 'running low on eggs' -> status: running_low). This endpoint is simpler and faster than routing through the full assistant - no conversation history, no streaming, just text-in/actions-out. It powers both the pantry onboarding card (currently broken with a 404) and the persistent voice-add button. The mobile app already has client code expecting this endpoint to exist.",

    "description": "Add a microphone button to the Pantry screen header that allows users to quickly add items via voice at any time, not just during onboarding. When tapped, the button starts voice recording; tapping again stops recording and processes the spoken items. The voice input uses the lightweight parse endpoint to extract items from natural speech (e.g., 'cherries, grapes, and some milk') and adds them directly to the pantry without requiring a full assistant conversation. Items are auto-added for speed - no confirmation step. This solves the problem that currently voice input only exists in the onboarding card, which disappears once the user has pantry items. Users who prefer voice input should be able to keep using it for ongoing additions without switching to the Assistant tab.",

Each go-to has a name and a freeform text field describing what's needed to make it (ingredients, amounts, notes). The data structure is intentionally simple: just a name string and a 'needs' text string. The list screen shows cards with the go-to name and a truncated preview of the needs text. Tapping a card opens the edit screen. The create/edit screen has two fields: a name input at the top, then a 'needs' label followed by a multiline text area. This creates a natural sentence structure: '[Name] needs [ingredients text]'. The text input includes a microphone button for voice input - users can tap to record and speak their ingredients naturally, which transcribes into the text field. A delete option appears at the bottom of the edit screen. The plus button in the header creates a new go-to.

(2) Use go-tos when adding to shopping list - when a user says 'add what I need for pork and beans', the Assistant looks up that go-to, checks the pantry for what's already in stock, and adds only the missing items to the shopping list. The Assistant should confirm what was added and mention if anything was skipped because it's already in the pantry. (3) Reference go-tos in general conversation - the Assistant should know what go-tos exist so it can suggest them or answer questions like 'what do I need to make my stir fry?' The go-to's 'needs' field is freeform text, so the Assistant interprets it contextually - it can handle specific items ('pinto beans'), vague descriptions ('some kind of protein'), and quantity hints ('lots of butter'). When checking pantry status against quantity hints, the Assistant should warn if an item is running low and the go-to needs 'a lot' of it.",
