    "description": "Refactor the data model to separate 'how much do I have' from 'do I want to buy more'. Currently, 'dormant' is a status that overwrites stock level (in_stock, running_low, out_of_stock), which conflates two different concepts. The fix: add a 'restocking' boolean field (default true) to pantry items, and remove 'dormant' from the status enum. Data model changes: Add 'restocking' boolean column to pantryItems table (default true). Remove 'dormant' from pantryItemStatus enum. Migration: existing dormant items become restocking=false with status='out_of_stock'. API changes: pantryItemUpdate accepts 'restocking' parameter, pantryItemList returns 'restocking' field, update type definitions in both API and mobile apps. UI changes: Rename 'Dormant Items' section to 'Bought Before' - this section shows items where restocking=false. Filter logic changes from status==='dormant' to restocking===false. Swipe action 'Dormant' becomes 'Set aside' and sets restocking=false (keeps current stock status). Swipe action 'Activate' sets restocking=true. Shopping list 'Don't want to buy it' sets restocking=false (keeps stock status intact). Remove 'dormant' from status picker on detail screen. Add restocking toggle to detail screen (separate from status picker). This change can be deployed all at once since there's only one user in production. The key benefit: a 'running low' item that the user doesn't want to restock stays visible in the main pantry (still running low) rather than disappearing into a separate section.",

    "description": "Fix the assistant chat so that confirmation prompts remain visible after the user responds. Currently, when the assistant asks for confirmation (e.g., 'Add black beans and cumin to your shopping list?') and the user taps Yes or No, the message bubble becomes blank. Instead, the bubble should show: (1) The full details of what the assistant proposed (e.g., 'Add black beans and cumin to shopping list'), and (2) A clear indicator of what the user chose and what happened. If confirmed: show that the action was executed (e.g., 'Added black beans and cumin to shopping list ✓' or similar confirmed state). If cancelled: show that the user declined (e.g., 'Add black beans and cumin to shopping list - Cancelled'). This gives users a clear history of what actions were proposed, what they decided, and what actually happened in their conversation with the assistant.",
