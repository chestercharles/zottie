    "name": "Contextual swipe behavior for shopping list items",
    "description": "The shopping list contains two types of items: staples (recurring pantry items that auto-appear when running low) and planned items (one-time additions). Currently, swiping to delete treats both the same - permanently removing them from the pantry. This is problematic for staples because users lose their recurring item tracking. Change the swipe behavior to be contextual based on item type: when swiping a staple, mark it as 'in stock' which removes it from the shopping list but preserves it in the pantry for future use; when swiping a planned item, delete it entirely since it was a one-time purchase. No confirmation dialog or toast feedback is needed - the visual removal is sufficient feedback. This preserves the value of staples (they'll reappear when marked running low again) while keeping the quick swipe gesture intuitive for both item types.",

    "name": "Use iOS-standard delete icon for swipe action",
    "description": "The swipe-left action on shopping list items currently displays a checkmark icon, which is confusing because tapping an item already toggles its checked state. Users expect swipe actions to be distinct from tap actions. Replace the checkmark icon with a trash/delete icon to follow iOS conventions and make the swipe action's purpose immediately clear. The underlying behavior (contextual action based on item type - marking staples as in-stock or deleting planned items) remains the same; only the visual icon changes from a checkmark to a delete/trash icon.",
