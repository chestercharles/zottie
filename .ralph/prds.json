    "description": "Replace the current FAB (floating action button) and full-screen form with an iOS-native bottom sheet pattern. A '+' button appears in the pantry screen's header bar (next to the settings icon). Tapping it opens a bottom sheet that slides up from the bottom of the screen. The sheet contains: a text input for item name (autofocused), a status selector with options 'In Stock' (default), 'Running Low', and 'Out of Stock', and an 'Add' button. The sheet can be dismissed by swiping down or tapping the backdrop. This replaces the current navigation to /pantry/create.",

Replace the current header/controls with: an X button in the top left corner to dismiss the sheet, and a checkmark button in the top right corner to add the item (replacing the current 'Add' button at the bottom). The text input and status selector remain in the body of the sheet. This provides a more spacious, focused experience for adding items and follows established iOS patterns.",

A '+' button appears in the shopping screen's header bar. Tapping it opens a full-screen bottom sheet (iOS Calendar style). The sheet has: an X button in the top left corner to dismiss, a checkmark button in the top right corner to add the item, and a text input for item name (autofocused) in the body. The status is always 'planned' so no selector is shown. This provides consistency with the pantry add-item UX.",

    "description": "Refactor the pantry list to use native-feeling iOS swipe actions. Replace the deprecated Swipeable component with ReanimatedSwipeable from react-native-gesture-handler/ReanimatedSwipeable. Replace the current ellipsis button pattern with direct labeled action buttons that appear on swipe, similar to iOS Mail. For staple items, show: 'Low' (orange, marks as running low), 'Out' (red, marks as out of stock). For all items, show 'Delete' (red) as a destructive action on the far right. Add haptic feedback using expo-haptics when swipe actions are triggered. Support full-swipe gesture to execute the primary action (mark as running low) without requiring a tap. The action buttons should have icons and short labels. Keep ActionSheetIOS as a fallback for less common actions accessible via a 'More' button if needed.",

Extract the PantryItemRow component to work with FlatList's renderItem pattern. Maintain the existing planned items collapsible section as a ListHeaderComponent or SectionList section. Ensure pull-to-refresh continues to work with RefreshControl. This improves scroll performance for users with many pantry items and aligns with React Native best practices for lists.",

Use ReanimatedSwipeable from react-native-gesture-handler/ReanimatedSwipeable. Swipe left to reveal: 'Purchased' (green, marks single item as purchased immediately) and 'Delete' (red, removes the item). Add haptic feedback using expo-haptics when swipe actions are triggered. Support full-swipe gesture to execute the primary action (mark as purchased). The existing checkbox pattern remains for batch operations, but swipe provides a quick single-item action. This complements the pantry swipe actions and provides a consistent interaction model across both lists.",
