A '+' button appears in the pantry screen's header bar (next to the settings icon). Tapping it opens a bottom sheet that slides up from the bottom of the screen. The sheet contains: a text input for item name (autofocused), a status selector with options 'In Stock' (default), 'Running Low', and 'Out of Stock', and an 'Add' button. The sheet can be dismissed by swiping down or tapping the backdrop. This replaces the current navigation to /pantry/create.",

A '+' button appears in the shopping screen's header bar. Tapping it opens a bottom sheet that slides up from the bottom. The sheet contains: a text input for item name (autofocused) and an 'Add' button. The status is always 'planned' so no selector is shown. The sheet can be dismissed by swiping down or tapping the backdrop. This provides consistency with the pantry add-item UX while keeping the simpler form appropriate for planned items.",
