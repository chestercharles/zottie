This helps users quickly identify which items are one-time planned purchases vs recurring staples. The icon should be subtle and not interfere with readability. This applies to planned items that appear in the main list (those with status 'in_stock' or 'running_low'), not to items in the collapsible 'Planned Items' section which are already clearly grouped.",

For staple items, the action sheet shows: 'Mark as Running Low', 'Mark as Out of Stock', 'Delete Item', and Cancel. For planned items, the action sheet shows: 'Mark as Running Low', 'Finished - Remove from Pantry', 'Finished - Convert to Staple', 'Delete Item', and Cancel. The 'Finished - Remove from Pantry' option removes the planned item entirely. The 'Finished - Convert to Staple' option changes the item's type to 'staple' and sets its status to 'out_of_stock' so it appears on the shopping list for re-purchase. This replaces the confusing behavior where tapping 'Out of Stock' on a planned item would trigger a removal confirmation.",

The sheet contains: a text input for item name (autofocused), a status selector with options 'In Stock' (default), 'Running Low', and 'Out of Stock', and an 'Add' button.

The sheet contains: a text input for item name (autofocused) and an 'Add' button. The status is always 'planned' so no selector is shown.
