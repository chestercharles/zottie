    "name": "Automatic OTA updates",
    "description": "Enable automatic over-the-air updates so users receive the latest app version without needing to go through the App Store. The app should check for updates on launch and silently download any available updates in the background. Updates are applied automatically on the next app restart with no user interaction required. This uses Expo's default update behavior - no custom UI or prompts needed. Implementation involves configuring expo-updates in app.config.js with appropriate runtime versioning and ensuring EAS Update is properly set up.",

    "name": "Smoother search overlay animation on Pantry screen",
    "description": "The search overlay animation on the Pantry screen feels too bouncy when appearing, which is inconsistent with iOS native search bar behavior. When the user taps the search icon in the header, the search bar slides down from the top but overshoots its final position before settling back. iOS native search animations (like in Settings or Mail apps) use critically-damped springs that slide smoothly without overshoot. The animation should be adjusted to feel more native and polished - a smooth, quick slide-in without the bounce. This affects the SearchOverlay component in the PantryListScreen.",

    "name": "Move drag handle above Settings modal header",
    "description": "The drag handle on the Settings modal currently appears below the 'Settings' navigation header, which looks incorrect. The drag handle should appear at the very top of the modal, above the header, to match iOS modal presentation conventions. When users see a modal sheet, the drag handle should be the first visual element at the top edge of the sheet, not buried below the title. This requires restructuring how the Settings screen renders its header - likely using a custom header layout that includes both the drag handle and the 'Settings' title within the screen content, rather than relying on the navigation-provided header. This affects the Settings screen presented from pantry/settings route.",

    "description": "Replace the current dark mode success/positive color (bright green #32D74B) with a teal/cyan color that better aligns with zottie's warm, empathetic personality. The current green feels too technical and 'hackery' - more appropriate for developer tools than a household app about cooking and meal prep. A teal/cyan maintains the positive/success meaning while feeling calmer and more modern. This affects the success color token in the design system (feedback.success in dark mode), which is used for: 'In Stock' status badges, checkmarks on completed shopping list items, success states in household join flow, and completed command indicators. The light mode success color can also be evaluated for consistency, but the primary concern is dark mode.",

    "name": "Fix add planned item sheet dismissal navigation",
    "description": "When the 'add new planned item' bottom sheet on the shopping list screen is dismissed (by pulling down), it incorrectly navigates to the pantry screen. The expected behavior is that dismissing this sheet should keep the user on the shopping list screen where they initiated the action. This is a navigation bug that breaks the user's context - they opened the sheet from shopping list and should return to shopping list when they cancel or dismiss it.",

    "name": "Direct swipe-to-delete on shopping list items",
    "description": "Simplify the delete interaction for shopping list items. Currently, swiping left on a shopping list item reveals a delete button that must be tapped to complete the deletion. Change this to a direct swipe-to-delete gesture: when the user swipes left past a threshold, the item should animate sliding off the screen and be deleted immediately. This reduces the deletion from a two-step action (swipe then tap) to a single gesture, making list management faster and more fluid. The slide-off animation should feel smooth and natural, providing clear feedback that the item is being removed. The implementation should follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for destructive swipe actions (including appropriate gesture thresholds, spring animations, and visual feedback) and use zottie's design system tokens for any colors or styling to ensure consistency across the app.",
