    "description": "When users tap the dismiss button (the large X outside the search input) on the pantry search interface, the search box should both hide AND clear the active search filter. Currently there are two X buttons: a small X inside the text input that clears the search text, and a large X outside that dismisses the search box. The issue is that dismissing the search box leaves the filter active, so users see filtered results without the search box visible, which is confusing. The fix: when the dismiss button is tapped, clear the search term and remove the filter so all items are shown again.",

When the user swipes up on the search box, it should dismiss (and follow the same behavior as tapping the dismiss X button - both hiding the search and clearing the filter).",

This is inconsistent with the settings page, where the handle is correctly positioned above the page title. The edit item sheet should match this pattern with the handle above the title. This likely requires using a custom header similar to how the settings page is structured.",

This is redundant. Remove the first status display so that only the status picker is shown, with the current status already highlighted within it.",

    "description": "When users are actively shopping and check items off their shopping list, those checked items should automatically move to the bottom of the list. This mirrors the behavior of iOS Notes app checklists. The use case is that while shopping in-store, users check items as they put them in their cart, but don't immediately mark them as purchased. Moving checked items to the bottom keeps the unchecked (still-needed) items at the top where they're most visible and actionable. Checked items remain visible at the bottom of the list in their checked state until the user explicitly marks them as purchased (which is a separate action).",
