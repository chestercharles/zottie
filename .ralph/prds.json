    "name": "(Onboarding Epic) Simplify onboarding to shopping list only",
    "description": "Streamline the onboarding flow to focus solely on the shopping list, removing both the pantry input step and the household invitation step. The new flow: user is asked 'What do you need from the store?', speaks their shopping list items via voice input, sees a brief processing screen, then lands directly in the app. This gets users to value faster - they can immediately use their shopping list without the upfront friction of documenting their entire pantry. The pantry setup becomes a separate, contextual experience (see companion PRD). The household invite feature remains accessible from settings for users who want to share lists later.",

    "name": "(Onboarding Epic) Pantry contextual onboarding card",
    "description": "Add an onboarding card to the Pantry tab that appears when the user has no in-stock items. This card pitches the value of filling out their pantry: 'Tell me what's in your pantry and I can help you figure out what to make for dinner, remind you when you're running low, and keep your shopping list updated automatically.' The card includes a prominent voice input button (reusing the voice input pattern from onboarding) so users can speak their pantry items naturally. The card persists until the user has added at least one in-stock item - there is no manual dismiss option. This creates a gentle but consistent nudge toward the pantry setup while letting users engage with it when they're ready, rather than forcing it during initial onboarding. If the pantry has planned items (from the shopping list) but no in-stock items, those planned items should still be visible below the onboarding card.",

    "name": "(Assistant Epic) Include last purchase date in Assistant context",
    "description": "Give the AI Assistant access to the last purchase date for items it reasons about. This helps the assistant understand item freshness when answering questions or making suggestions. For example, if a user asks 'should I buy more milk?', the assistant can factor in that they last purchased milk 2 weeks ago. The last purchase date should be included in the context for any items the assistant is reasoning about - whether they're currently in the pantry, on the shopping list, or just mentioned in the conversation. This is backend-only; the last purchase date doesn't need to be displayed in the app UI.",

    "name": "(Assistant Epic) Anchor input at bottom of chat",
    "description": "Move the Assistant's input controls to the bottom of the screen following standard chat app conventions. The input area should contain a text field and a microphone button to the right of it. Tapping the text field lets users type their message. Tapping the microphone button starts voice recording; tapping it again stops recording and inserts the transcription into the input. This replaces the current inline 'type a follow-up' element that appears after messages in the middle of the chat.",

    "name": "(Assistant Epic) Standard chat scroll behavior",
    "description": "Update the Assistant chat to use standard chat scroll behavior where new messages appear at the bottom and older messages scroll upward. The view should stay anchored to the bottom so users always see the latest messages. As the assistant streams its response, the view should auto-scroll to keep the new content visible.",

    "name": "(Assistant Epic) Add new conversation button to header",
    "description": "Add a button in the top-right of the Assistant tab header that starts a new conversation. Tapping it clears the current conversation history and returns to a fresh chat state. This gives users an explicit way to start over rather than having conversations auto-clear or persist indefinitely.",

    "name": "Remove Commands tab and related code",
    "description": "Remove the Commands tab entirely from the app, along with all related code and backend endpoints. The Assistant feature has replaced the Commands functionality. This includes: removing the Commands tab from navigation, deleting the Commands UI components, removing any backend endpoints that were exclusively used by the Commands feature, and cleaning up any related state management or hooks. Before deleting, verify that no code is shared with the Assistant feature - the implementer should check for any dependencies between Commands and Assistant to ensure nothing breaks. If shared utilities or components are found, they should be preserved and only the Commands-specific code removed.",

    "name": "Display dormant items in separate section at bottom of pantry",
    "description": "On the pantry list screen, items with 'dormant' status should be visually separated from active pantry items and displayed at the bottom of the list in their own section. This keeps the main pantry view focused on items the user is actively tracking while still giving visibility to dormant items (things they own but don't intend to repurchase). The dormant section should be clearly labeled so users understand why these items are separated. Dormant items remain tappable to view/edit details. Note: dormancy is independent of stock status - an item can be 'running low' AND dormant (user has some left but doesn't plan to buy more).",

    "description": "Add a swipe gesture on pantry list items to toggle dormancy. When swiping on a non-dormant item, the action should mark it as dormant. When swiping on a dormant item (in the dormant section), the action should reactivate it (remove dormancy). This provides a quick way to manage dormancy without opening the item detail screen. The swipe action should be visually distinct from any existing swipe actions and clearly communicate what will happen.",

    "description": "Add a way to toggle an item's dormancy from the item detail bottom sheet. This should be separate from the status picker (in-stock, running low, out of stock) since dormancy is an independent attribute - an item can be both 'running low' AND dormant. Users should be able to mark any item as dormant regardless of its current stock status, and should be able to reactivate dormant items from this screen as well.",
