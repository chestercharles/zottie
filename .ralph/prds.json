    "description": "The shopping list contains two types of items: staples (recurring pantry items that auto-appear when running low) and planned items (one-time additions). Currently, swiping to delete treats both the same - permanently removing them from the pantry. This is problematic for staples because users lose their recurring item tracking. Change the swipe behavior to be contextual based on item type: when swiping a staple, mark it as 'in stock' which removes it from the shopping list but preserves it in the pantry for future use; when swiping a planned item, delete it entirely since it was a one-time purchase. No confirmation dialog or toast feedback is needed - the visual removal is sufficient feedback. This preserves the value of staples (they'll reappear when marked running low again) while keeping the quick swipe gesture intuitive for both item types.",
