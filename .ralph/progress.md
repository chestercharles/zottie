### First-time user household onboarding flow

- Created `OnboardingScreen` component in `features/onboarding/`:
  - Shows welcome message with home icon
  - Text input for household name (required)
  - "Create Household" primary button using `useCreateHousehold` hook
  - Divider with "or"
  - "Join an Existing Household" section explaining invite link requirement
  - Loading state while creating, error handling for failures
  - Keyboard avoiding behavior for iOS
- Created route at `app/onboarding.tsx`:
  - Imports OnboardingScreen
  - Passes `onSuccess` callback that navigates to pantry
- Updated `app/index.tsx` to detect first-time users:
  - Uses `useHouseholdMembership` hook to check if user has a household
  - If authenticated but no household (and no pending invite), redirects to `/onboarding`
  - If has household, continues to pantry as before
  - Loading state shown while checking household membership
- Updated `app/_layout.tsx` to include onboarding route in Stack navigation
- Flow: Authenticated user without household → Onboarding screen → Create household → Navigate to pantry
