## Pantry search icon in navigation header

Added a magnifying glass search icon to the pantry screen's navigation header, positioned to the left of the existing add (+) and settings icons. Tapping the icon triggers entry into search mode (state is tracked via `isSearchMode`). Removed the always-visible inline search bar from the main content area, so the pantry list now shows all items without the search input taking up space when not in search mode.

Changes:
- Added `isSearchMode` state to track search mode
- Added search icon to `headerRight` in navigation options
- Removed inline search bar from pantry list content
- Search icon color changes to primary action color when search mode is active
- Added accessibility labels to all header icons
