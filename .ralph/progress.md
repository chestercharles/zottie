## 2026-01-13: Commands parsing backend endpoint

Implemented the `POST /api/commands/parse` endpoint that processes natural language commands using OpenAI.

### What was built

- Added OpenAI package dependency
- Created Zod schemas for command actions (`CommandAction`, `CommandParseRequest`, `CommandParseResponse`)
- Created `CommandParseEndpoint` that:
  - Fetches user's current pantry items for context
  - Sends the command to GPT-4o-mini with a system prompt explaining the action types
  - Returns structured actions that the frontend can display and execute

### Supported action types

- `add_to_pantry`: Add a new item with a specified status
- `update_pantry_status`: Update an existing item's status
- `remove_from_shopping_list`: Mark an item as in_stock (removing it from shopping consideration)

### Smart intent handling

The AI is instructed to be smart about user intent - if a user says "mark apples as running low" but apples aren't in the pantry, it will return an `add_to_pantry` action with status `running_low` rather than failing.

### Configuration required

The `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable must be set (as a secret in production, or in `.dev.vars` locally)
